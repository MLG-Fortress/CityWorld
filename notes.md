### OreProvider sets the material type of the surface and underground

Also sets the fluids and blocks surrounding the fluids

e.g. from astral:

```java
		surfaceMaterial = Material.SOUL_SAND;
		subsurfaceMaterial = Material.ICE;
		stratumMaterial = Material.PACKED_ICE;
		substratumMaterial = Material.BEDROCK;

		fluidMaterial = Material.LAVA;
		fluidFluidMaterial = Material.LAVA;
		fluidSurfaceMaterial = Material.FROSTED_ICE;
		fluidSubsurfaceMaterial = Material.FROSTED_ICE;
		fluidFrozenMaterial = Material.FROSTED_ICE;
```
